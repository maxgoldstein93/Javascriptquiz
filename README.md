INTRODUCTION: Javascript Quiz

This is a Javascript quiz that I have created for web development students to test their knowledge against a clock. The quiz works by pressing the start button which also starts a timer, and displays the first question. At the end of the quiz at either the last question or when the timer hits zero a form will appear to input user data to save to local storage. This data is then displayed when clicking the highscore link to show the user initials and the time it took them to take the quiz. I have attached a link to a GIF of the working quiz and a link to take the quiz.

The quiz is broken down into an index.html that holds all of the outline for the page and most importantly the classes and idâ€™s that are referenced with javascript. With javascript I created variables to create elements and add text to my page that was not there before and to add event listeners to start the quiz. I also created functions to check answers, start and stop a clock, hide and display containers, and saved data to local storage. I used conditional statements and JSON.
